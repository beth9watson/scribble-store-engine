The Scribble Store is still in early development.

At its core this is an image gallery application, but I'd like users to specifically upload images of scribbles on a light background. I would then draw something more tangible on top of their uploaded scribbles, and send the finished drawing back to them. Collaborative art. Through scribbles!

Learning Focus:
1) Cropping images using Rails instead of JavaScript! Previously I had always relied on hefty JS plugins to crop images. 
2) Image hosting with Amazon AWS! This was the first time I ever configured AWS image uploading from scratch.
3) Rails Engines! I chose to develop this app as a Rails engine partly to gain experience with that process, but also because it allowed me to isolate the Scribble Store code and still host it on the same Heroku app as my personal website.
